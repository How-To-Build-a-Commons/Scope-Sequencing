# How To Build a Commons
This organization exists to teach a class in the present and document the process for the future.  
We recognize the existence of Common Pool Resources bequeathed to us all by our learning community - our shared pedagogical time and collaborative curriculum, both sustained by the precious attention and trust our students provide.

## Scope & Sequencing
This repository hosts the Scope & Sequencing document for the How To Build a Commons curriculum.

## Governance Structure of Steering Committee
